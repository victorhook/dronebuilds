      <description>Utilizing f8 fc brushed AIO this build became quite neat!
The frame is create by carbon fibre tubes (4x2) and 3D-printed adaptors and motor mounts.
The 3D printed parts and motors are held together with pressfit and epoxy. There are 4 threaded inserts in the middle for the flight controller (30.5 x 30.5).
Once everything was put together I had to add some nice paint to it!
