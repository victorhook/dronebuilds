![Overview](resources/overview.jpg)

Utilizing [f8 fc](/dronebuilds/posts/f8-fc/) brushed AIO this build became quite neat!

The frame is create by carbon fibre tubes (4x2) and 3D-printed adaptors and motor mounts.

![Build 1](resources/build1.jpg)

The 3D printed parts and motors are held together with pressfit and epoxy. There are 4 threaded inserts in the middle for the flight controller (30.5 x 30.5).

Once everything was put together I had to add some nice paint to it!

A part from the components above I have used 3D printed parts in PLA, epoxy, bolts & nuts.

**Total price: ~55$**

## Project Result
Hover flight time was approximately 2 minutes. I think the main issue is that it weighs too much, so further revisions should make it even lighter!
